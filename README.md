### quitstreaming

A practice tool for improving osu! stamina, built with the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) game engine. Designed to add more features and overall just be better than [you suck at streaming v2](https://ckrisirkc.github.io/osuStreamSpeed.js/newindex.html).

Right now it's in a very barebones state, but theoretically it could be something cool in the future. 

To run, download the source code and install [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/), then run `love /path/to/folder/` in a terminal. In the future I will probably release a windows binary and maybe host it on github pages using [love.js](https://github.com/Davidobot/love.js).

TODO:
- Add UI and adjustable settings
- Add some color to the consistency bars 
- Add a speed-over-time graph like ysasv2 (sounds tough to do)
